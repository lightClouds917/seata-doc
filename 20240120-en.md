# Topics for Discussion

1. Confirmation of unique identification using resource id + application name @建斌 (Lower priority, currently no time)
   - Resource id may be duplicated, causing deployment issues; Ensure uniqueness; The final solution is pending; Prepare documentation for the next meeting; Requires dynamic extension capability;

2. Confirmation of TCC usage, whether to be compatible with special usage patterns @亦夏 @宗杰 (Follow-up PRs to be provided)
   - Unified specification: Standardize the Java TCC annotation, unify it on the implementation class; After completing this, it needs to be reflected in the documentation; Also, deprecate LocalTcc annotation and use TwoPhase annotation; Done
   - Reminder for the usage of TCC annotations; If the two-phase annotation is placed on an interface, the default behavior is as follows: For supported RPC frameworks, a warning is displayed; For unsupported RPC frameworks, an exception is raised; The behavior can be controlled by the same switch, determining whether to display a warning log or an exception prompt; Todo

3. Seata Go direction
   - Compliance governance: Governance of repositories, some dependency packages, CVE vulnerability fixes @亦夏 @清铭 @月财
   - Construction and implementation of Seata Go saga framework @亦夏 @祥琨 @靖浏
      - Preliminary tasks completed [https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/wiki/20231213]
   - Align Seata Go with features and bug fixes in Seata Java; Currently aligning with version 1.5.1, needs an upgrade (following the changes in 2.x, not maintaining a dual-branch strategy) @月财, start by achieving the set goals
   - Ecological expansion: Services frameworks such as Bilibili; @清铭 ByteDance @hong fan To be decided next week or by the end of January

6. Claiming the RocketMQ integration task: (明华)
   - SummerCode 2021 project, PR submitted by student for basic implementation, PR not merged, needs to be integrated into the 2.x branch, planned for release in version 2.1.0. The student in charge of this project cannot be contacted. Currently, a senior developer is needed to claim this task and move it forward.
   - Project details: https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/issues/3752
   - Existing PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/pull/3974

7. RocketMQ integration solution (谢明华): Schedule a meeting to accelerate progress
   - Which messages need to be proxied:
       - Option 1: Only proxy transaction messages (sendMessageInTransaction), which is more in line with user behavior intentions;
       - Option 2: Proxy all messages for better consistency, but may not be in line with user intentions.
       - Option 3: Provide a manual call API
       - Any other optimal solution?

   Splitting PRs for multiple version protocols is not in the 2.1 plan;

    - If TM/RM is not initialized, RM registration will not be ignored, and an exception will be thrown directly; Todo
    - Confirm whether RM registration will be executed when `io.seata.core.rpc.netty.RmNettyRemotingClient#registerResource` is true.

11. Jackson is a strong dependency; modify scope-provided to compile dependency - @亦夏 @海涛

    - Saga enhancement; Console saga designer overhaul; Driven by frontend resources, tasks are catching up;
